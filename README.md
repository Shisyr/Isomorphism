# Isomorphism
Algorithm that can find Isomorphism between two graph with equal vertices.
1. You input size of vertices!
2. You need to input adjacent matrix of first and second graphs.
3. Calculate.

Result:
If there is isomorphism, then the one will show you the correct adjacent matrix with sort vertices.
